This document is intended to act as an essential “survival kit” for young
Influencers who have just taken their first steps in the industry, as well as
for more experienced Influencers who cannot count on specialized legal counsel
operating in this field yet.

To this end, it is important to make some final observations. The legal field is
ever faced with new realities related to the use of new technologies. This
document will also serve as an informational piece for lawyers looking to gain a
better understanding of Influencer Marketing.
